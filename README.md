Benjamin Shlamovsky-Koroz, This is the Version control for the final test

Sip_Saver_Proj_V7 is used for python code for the web app

Comp120-401 Final Project is used the template for the web app

SipSaver is a Python based wep application designed as part of the final project for COMP120-401. Its goal is to help users track, manage, and optimize their coffee consumption habits, saving both money and health through data driven insights.

Working on SipSaver was an enriching experience that allowed me to apply foundational software engineering principles. I had a lot of fun working with the team that I chose. I Learned a lot from using GitHub and Jira throughout this project.

I have accomplished: 
Created project on github
Set up a milestone
Created Issue 1 and assigned to myself
Created Issue 2 and assigned to myself
Cloned the repository locally
Wrote a description and reflection

Completing these small tasks has honed my skills further in my ability to creating version control documentation in GitHub
